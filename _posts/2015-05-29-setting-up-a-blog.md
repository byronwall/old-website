This post contains a little bit of info about how I got this Jekyl blog setup.  It's your standard first post...

Fork a copy of Skinny Bones.  Fortunately, this is bare bones enough that Git Hub can build it outright.

Add a little bit of starter info to the `\_config.yml` file. **Don't accidentally leave out the space between the `:` in the key-value pairs**

Cloned a copy of the repository to a local directory to avoid creating everything in the web interface.  Using Git Hub for Windows saves a lot of hassle over the other interfaces available.

Created a posts folder with a ~~blog subfolder~~.  Do not create the subfolders for this.  Instead use the `cateogry` tag inside the front matter to create the permalink to _look_ like a subfolder.

Moved an image over for the teaser.  Link here does not need to include `/images/`, just the file name.

Things left to do
 - modify the home page to look more professional, guess I need some HTML for this
 - create portfolio section and give it a nav link
 - create a couple more blog posts to see how they all lineup together
 - create a static page or two and see how those work
