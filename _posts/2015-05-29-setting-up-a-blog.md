This post contains a little bit of info about how I got this Jekyl blog setup.  It's your standard first post...

fork a copy of Skinny Bones

add a little bit of starter info to the `\_config.yml` file. **don't accidentally leave out the space between the `:` in the key-value pairs**

cloned a copy of the repository to a local directory to avoid creating everything in the web interface

created a posts folder with a blog subfolder

trying to get as much of the file to look like the demo site now...
